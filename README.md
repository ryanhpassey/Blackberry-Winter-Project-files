# **Unity code for Blackberry Winter**

 

These are all C# code written by me for various objects in my Unity game. These files alone are not enough to run the game.

 

The code includes

 

- Movement Code

- A player state machine

- A PlayerState class that defines states the player can be in (moving, attacking, etc.)

- An (attempt at an) event delegate that hasn't been implemented

- Unity Scriptable Objects

- Two interfaces: ILearnable and IDamageable
