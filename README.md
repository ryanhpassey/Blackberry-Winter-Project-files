# **Unity code for Blackberry Winter**

 

These are all C# code written by me for various objects in my Unity game. These files alone are not enough to run the game.

 

The code includes

 

- "Ability" Code

- Enemy State Machine

- An Event Delegate

- Unity Scriptable Objects

- Two interfaces: ILearnable and IDamageable

- etc
